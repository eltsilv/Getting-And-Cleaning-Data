CodeBook for the tidy dataset project
Data source

Source data for this project is Samsung's "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" which is avaiable at:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
In the original set of data, there is a file namd features.txt that explains the features collected for the data set.
The project requires that only Mean and Standard Deviations Measures are extracted to the new tidy dataset, so the other colums were removed.
